Assignment 3- EU Barometer Public Opinion Trust in NATO Winter 2021-2023

NATO Public Approval Ratings per EU Region pre- and post-Russian Invasion

Before 2021, NATO was seen by some as a dying alliance – a relic of an era of
American bipolarity and hegemony. But after Putin’s invasion, Europe’s stable rulesbased
liberal international order was threatened. Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it a
Zeitenwende. Russia’s invasion should lead directly to a change in threat perceptions
by EU member states and thus a change in perceptions of the security alliance. There
are many overall public opinion polls towards NATO – but very few have dug deep into
a country and regional level of analysis. No alliance is fully homogeneous, and threat
perceptions to world order could vary among members.

To determine public opinion on NATO both pre-and post-Russian invasion, I
chose publicly available data from the yearly standard Eurobarometer poll. This figure
shows a comparative European regional and country level analysis on public opinion
percentages in 2021, 2022, and 2023 for the question: How much trust do you have in
NATO? See Appendix A for figure.

From Winter 2021 to 2022, most European states’ trust in NATO declined. In
some instances (like in the Baltic, Nordic, and Western states) the decline was so
drastic to decrease by 15 to 20 points. This shows in the lead up to the Russian
invasion, public trust in NATO was rapidly declining. However, after the invasion
(February 2022), this decline either plateaued or increased again for most states. In the
West, public trust bounced back to 2021 levels for most.

The Eastern flank of NATO should, theoretically, have the highest threat
perception from the Russian invasion. Poland has emerged since the invasion as a
staunch proponent of NATO and follows in this data a diverging trend from its central
and eastern European neighbors. Interestingly, Baltic support in Latvia and Lithuania
have increased to almost pre-invasion levels, yet Estonia’s trust has drastically
decreased by 20 points. Approval ratings in Finland and Sweden (both new or soon-tobe
NATO states), have also drastically increased trust in NATO since the war. For the
Eastern and Central states, trust in NATO seems lower and potentially even declining in
comparison to the Western, Nordic, and Baltic states. This is an important finding, as
Western NATO states must seek to reassure credibility among NATO for the more
threatened Eastern allies.
